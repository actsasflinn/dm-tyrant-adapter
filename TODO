* basic specs for connecting through rufus-tokyo
* basic saving of attributes to a table database record (figure out what if any type_map is needed)
* add transaction support (from rufus)
* use Rufus::Tokyo::TableResultSet for queries (it's the only way to do length properly and I think it'll handle iteration)
